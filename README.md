# facebook-video-speed-control

Facebook currently has no speed playback controls for their videos to speed or slow them down, much like how YouTube does it.

Until Facebook itself implements the feature, may this Chrome extension serve as your interim solution.

## Installation

As of this writing, the app is still pending approval from the Chrome Web Store. I will update this document once the app gets published.

## Contributing

I will update this document to detail how interested people can contribute to the code. But everyone is free to file feature requests and bug reports on this repo's Issues page.
